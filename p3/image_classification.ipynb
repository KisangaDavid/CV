        "(1) Image Classification. Predict image-level category labels on two historically notable image datasets: **CIFAR-10** and **MNIST**.\n",

It is highly recommended to read the official [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) and [examples](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html) before starting your implementation. There are some APIs that you'll find useful:\n",
